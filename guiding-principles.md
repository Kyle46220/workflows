its always better to rollback and re-write a prompt, rather than debug the outputed code. 

state the obvious, make it explicit even when you know the ai will understand it implicitly anyway. 

keep chat context clean - only have one main line of reasoning in any chat, else the ai gets confused and responds with dumber shit. 
have main chat and then do little sandboxed sidebars in other chats, or branch the chat. then summarise findings and report these back to the main chat as "ideas from another developer"

use images for ui as much as possible. 

i think of it as like managing a team of super confident idiot savants with amnesia. they have no common sense, and need to be told exactly what to do, and reminded constantly. 

separate planning from implemetnation. get the ai to descibe its plan, then you and maybe an ai review it. and then implement following the plan. 

alwasy be concise and ask the ai to only implement the necessary features anmd nothing else (especailly claude sonnet)
