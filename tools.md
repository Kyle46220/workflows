# Ai Tools for web development

## Cursor IDE (a version of vs code)
  - has .cursor/rules which is super useful. 
  - has coding agent but this is sometimes not so useful and creates more bugs.  

## Vscode extensions (work with cursor)

  - gemini coder https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertpiosik.gemini-coder  
    - selects fileis to load inito context of chatbot (like aistudio)
 - Cline - this is an automated coding agent that gets really expensiive really quickl but might be useful. 

## Chatbot interfaces 

### Ai Studio https://aistudio.google.com/
 - this is just a chat interface where you can paste in your whole project if you use gemini coder. its good because its free. and it never runs out of context. 

### Claude Desktop
 if you use Claude you can easily add your project github repo to a chat so it can understand i. but it doesn't have a bigger context window so aistudio/geminicoder is better.  

## Deepseek 
 - https://www.deepseek.com/ 
 - it has this really good reasoning where if you give it a logic problem it will just keep thinking about it until it has a solution. 

## Coding agents
    - claude code - this is prettty good at implementing full features automaticallyy that work wihtout breaking stuff. but it gets expensive pretty quickly. 
    - Gemini code - i haven't used this but similar using gemini 2.5 (which is the best one)

## Agents
 - Manus Ai - this is a really good agent where you just type what you want and it will spend a couple of hours building the whole project, and testing and deploying. you only get a couple of goes with free credits. you need to specify what you want in lots of detail.  
 - genspark super agent https://www.genspark.ai/ - apparently smarter than manus ai but haven't used it much yet. 

- Devin - havent used this yet, but it thinks its pretty good especially cos it manages project documentation as well as the code. 

## app prototype builders
 They all kind of do the same thing. you just type in what yoyu want and it builds a ui. I think Replit can do Flutter apps.   
 - Replit  https://replit.com/
 - v0 https://v0.dev/
 - Bolt https://bolt.new/

## Documentation
 - Codeguide - https://www.codeguide.dev/
  - you describe your app and it will give you a set of docs you would need to specify your project. it can be good to get an idea of what your project docs might look like so you can understand it better. but for my project the docs weren't precise enough to be that useful.
