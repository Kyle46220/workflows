New workflow using augment code agent and Ai studio. 

I load to context into ai-studio. with the prompt descfibinig the refactor implementation ii'd like to do.
ask the following 
"show your undersstanding of my idea.brainstorm some ideas about ways this could be implemented. Don't implement it yet."
"what info or documentation would be required if we handed this over to another developer to implement?"
"write the docs"
"write some unit tests"

copy all docs and tests over to augment code and ask it to run the implemntation from these.
