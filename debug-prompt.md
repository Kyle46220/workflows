# Error Fixing

to fix an error follow these steps. 
1. Lay out exactly how this code works
2. Show all the connecting pieces
3. Include relevant code snippets
4. Think step by step

and always consider the following:

- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! consider multiple possible causes before deciding.
- explain the problem in clear english.
- make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a perplexity web search to find the latest up to date information.
- comment code thoroughly for a junior devoloper who is trying to learn. use JSDocs format for making documentation later. 
- keep all code simple.
