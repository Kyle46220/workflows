# MDC Rule Creation Standards

## Context
Applies when creating or modifying MDC rule files to ensure:
- Consistent structure across rules
- Effective AI comprehension
- Maintainable rule hierarchy

## Requirements
1. **File Organization**
   - Store in `.cursor/rules/` directory
   - Use `NNN_name.mdc` naming (001-299 numbering)
   - Group by prefix ranges:
     - 001-099: Core workspace rules
     - 100-199: Integration rules
     - 200-299: Pattern rules

2. **Header Structure**  
   Mandatory frontmatter fields:
   ```
   ---
   description: 
   globs: 
   tags: []
   priority: 
   version: 
   ---
   ```

3. **Content Standards**
   - Keep body under 25 lines
   - Use H2 headers for main sections
   - Include both positive and negative examples
   - Reference related rules with @ notation
   - Avoid absolute file paths in globs

## Examples


Good: Modern React component pattern
```

globs: src/components/**/*.tsx
tags: [react, components]

# React Component Standards

**File Structure**
- Use named exports
- Separate concerns with hooks
- Type props with TypeScript
```



Poor: Vague component rule
```
# Components
Make good components
Put files where they belong
```
